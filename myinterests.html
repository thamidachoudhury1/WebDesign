    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>
        I majored in computer science because I have a passion in coding. I enjoy using my creativity to make things come into fruition. 
        There are endless of opportunities with technology and I have just begun to scratch the surface.

        Hobbies outside of my major include painting and gaming. I have a garden in my backyard where I grow vegetables.
        I also have a garden in my front yard where I grow all types of flowers including roses. 
        I enjoy gardening as it is an activity that I am able to do it with my parents and it is a bonding experience with my family.
        Additionally, I enjoy painting, gaming, and cooking. These are activities I can do when I feel very stressed about school.
