    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is <b>Thamida Choudhury</b> and I am a senior studying computer science.
        My parents are from Bangladesh, but immigrated here in their 20s.
        I grew up in Astoria, Queens, but moved to Jamaica, Queens in my freshman year of college.
    </p>
    <p>
        For high school, I went to an international school where I received the International Baccalaureate diploma. 
        Unlike APs, we took tests for our subjects after four years of taking the subject. 
        This taught me hard work and dedication, which I carried with me into college.
